            Bella Hadid was born in Washington, DC and raised in Santa Barbara, California. She is the daughter of Palestinian real estate billionaire Mohamed Hadid and former Dutch model Yolanda Hadid (née van den Herik). Her siblings include Marielle, Alana, Gigi, and Anwar, all of whom work in the fashion business. They were reared Muslim, and, in a 2017 interview with Porter magazine, Hadid stated she was still a proud Muslim.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hadid began modeling at the age of 16 with a commercial for Flynn Skye, a women's apparel brand. Her career took off after she walked for Desigual, a Spanish fashion house, during New York Fashion Week in the autumn of 2014, then months later went on the runway for Tom Ford's collection. She quickly began walking at other big fashion events, such as the London and Paris fashion weeks. In late 2015, she made her Chanel debut while simultaneously appearing on the covers of magazines such as Seventeen and Elle. Hadid and her sister Gigi made their runway debut for Chanel Haute Couture in 2016. According to Hadid, she and Gigi have seldom competed in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2016, Hadid signed her first beauty commercial deal as Dior Beauty's brand ambassador. She became one of the most famous faces in modeling, walking in high-profile shows for a number of fashion brands and increasing their sales. In 2022, the companies she marched for had an average increase of roughly 30% in social media engagement. Her honors include many nominations for Model of the Year, a title she received from GQ in 2016 and the British Fashion Awards in 2022.
